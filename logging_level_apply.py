    In most cases, you donâ€™t want to read too much details in the log file. 
    Therefore, debug level is only enabled when you are debugging. I use 
    debug level only for detail debugging information, especially when the 
    data is big or the frequency is high, such as records of algorithm 
    internal state changes in a for-loop.
